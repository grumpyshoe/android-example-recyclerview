# Example Project - RecyclerView

This project is just a summary of how to implement a RecyclerView, based on my template project also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/grumpyshoe/android-project-template) 

For now it only includes:
1. retrieving data from the open REST Api [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
2. storing data in local SQlite-DB by using room
3. show data on ui in recyclerview
4. change recyclerview aninmation for showing data

Feel free to contact me if something is incomprehensible or you have suggestions for improvement.
